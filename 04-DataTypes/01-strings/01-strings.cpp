 * @brief   Write a program that asks the user to enter their full name and 
 *          their age. As output, tell the user the sum of their age and the 
 *          number of letters in their name (use the std::string::length() 
 *          member function to get the length of the string). For simplicity, 
 *          count any spaces in the name as a letter.
 * 
 *          Sample output:
 * 
 *              Enter your full name: John Doe
 *              Enter your age: 32
 *              Your age + length of name is: 40
 * 
 * @version 0.1.0
