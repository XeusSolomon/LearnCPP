 * @brief   The following program is supposed to add two numbers, but doesnâ€™t 
 *          work correctly.
 *          Use the integrated debugger to step through this program and watch 
 *          the value of x. Based on the information you learn, fix the program.
 * @version 0.1.2

 *  Inspection guess wrong - ouput is second input only;
